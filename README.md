# Fan sentiment analysis
Can the voice of fans help us understand Formula 1 better? <br/>
This project says **yes** (and uses natural language processing to decode what fans feel about drivers, races, and events).<br/>

# About this project
By analyzing fan posts and social media sentiment, this project uncovers how drivers and teams were perceived in the lead-up to Monza 2025.  
It uses NLP techniques to classify sentiment, highlight trending topics, and identify peak discussion hours. The goal: translate fan buzz into actionable insight.<br/>

# Features

ðŸ“ˆ Trending terms and hashtags based on fan discussions <br/>
ðŸ•“ Activity heatmap showing when fans were most active <br/> 
ðŸŽ¯ Recommendations for teams based on sentiment trends <br/>

# Tech stack
- Python, pandas, NumPy
- scikit-learn

# How it works 
1. Collect fan text data and preprocess it (cleaning, tokenization, etc.)
2. Apply sentiment analysis using VADER and rule-based logic
3. Extract key terms, peak hours, and sentiment scores
4. Save results to `fan_sentiment_analysis_results.csv`
